                    <p>I am an apsiring cloud engineer based in Manchester, UK who recently graduated from AWS/reStart programme from Generations and shortly after achieved an AWS Cloud
                    practitioneer certification. Currently I am looking for any junior or apprentice position opportunities based on cloud technology.<p>
                    <p>I have always been passionate and keen about technology growing up which led me to achieving a degree within games art involving 3D modeling and using industry 
                      standard softwares(you can find some of my work <a href="https://www.artstation.com/simonl-art">here</a>). Later I found an opportunity to learn more about cloud 
                      technology with little prior knowledge through the AWS bootcamp and applied there. Throughout the AWS programme I managed to obtain the foundational knowledge of Linux, 
                      networking, software development, database, python, core services of AWS and improving my soft skills in general with the help of my peers and instructor.
